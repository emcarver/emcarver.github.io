THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCITON THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION THIS WEBSITE IS STILL UNDER CONStrUCTION!!

Hi there! I'm a physics student at the University of Lethbridge with a passion for astronomy. 

I don't know what to include in this part fo the page so I will just put a bunch and then edit later. 

Completed a co-op work semester at the Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre in Victoria, BC under the supervision of Dr. Doug Johnstone and Dr. Toby Brown. I studied visibility modelling techniques and their applications to observations of galaxies with ALMA. 

Completed a summer research project at the University of Lethbridge in Lethbridge, AB under the supervision of Dr. Alex Tetarenko. I used ALMA observations to investigate time and frequency-based variations in the jets of black hole X-ray binary systems. 

Make some kind of claim about research interests?? But tbh I am still very much figuring that out myself.
