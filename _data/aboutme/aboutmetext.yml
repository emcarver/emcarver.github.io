  lvlone: "Hi there! My name is Emily Carver and I am currently a 4th year physics student at the University of Lethbridge. I grew up in a small town near Lethbridge, where I've always been curious about understanding the world around me through studying the sciences. I chose to study physics at ULethbridge as a route to ultimately pursue research in astronomy and astrophysics. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of research in astrophysics and becuase I have limited experience so far, I don't want to close myself off to research topics. However, my current main research interests are multiwavelength and multimessenger astronomy, and compact objects."

  lvlone: "I've grown up constantly surrounded by inspiring women, from having my curiosity for the sciences supported by a mother and grandmother with careers teaching STEM in school, to my time in sports learning leadership from inspiring female head coaches, to completing my first internship with an accomplished female researcher. I know that my current self was strongly shaped by those who guided me and acted as role models, and that inspiration and empowerment can bring young girls into the sciences and keep them there. Because of this, I am greatly interested in outreach efforts that support women and girls in STEM."

  lvlone: 'Outside of school, I keep myself busy by baking treats to share, losing to my friends in board games, or getting overly invested in a crochet project for only a week at a time. I also love to search for CDs to add to my eclectic collection that, due to the unpredictable nature of thrift store stock, features genres from dance-punk revival to country rock to Cantopop.'
