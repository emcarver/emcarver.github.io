- title: 'Investigating the Evolution of Black Hole Jets at Millimetre Wavelengths'
  description: 'Stellar mass black holes in our the Milky Way Galaxy often exist in binary systems with a companion star, where material from the companion star accretes onto the black hole. These systems go through periods of quiescence and outburst, where properties of the accretion flow and disk change, and jets may be launched and quenched. However, the exact mechanisms by which these jets are formed is still unknown. Multiwavelength studies of the magnitude and timescale of variation in the jet intensity can allow for jet properties to be measured, and the relationship between the jets and accretion flow to be understood. In this project, I used observations from the Atacama Large (Sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA) to characterize jet variability over the 2022 and 2024 outbursts of the black hole X-ray binary system GX 339-4. The figure below shows the flux density of GX 339-4 changing over time, and across observed frequencies. This demonstrates the differing amplitudes and timescales of variability of the jet at millimetre wavelengths. This project introduced me to essential concepts of radio astronomy and interferometry, and allowed me to build skills in astronomical data analysis.'
