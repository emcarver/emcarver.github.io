- title: 'Visibility Modelling of Galactic Star-Forming Regions at Millimetre Wavelengths'
  description: 'Unlike those from single-dish telescopes, measurements of the sky made by radio interferometers come in the form of complex visibilities. In order to reconstruct an image of the sky for analysis, the visibilities must be processed, but parameters within this imaging process introduce biases and artifacts to the final image. For example, weighting the data to emphasize measurements from the longest baselines will produce an image with a higher angular resolution, but a lower sensitivity. However, by working directly with the measured visibilities, it is possible to perform analysis where these introduced biases do not have to be taken into account. By creating a model and generating model visibilities based on your observational setup, it is possible to fit structures at a sub-beam level, and with improved sensitivity. This visibility modelling method has been used extensively in the study of protoplanetary disks which are often small, symmetric structures, but has not largely been applied to other systems. In this project, I investigated how visibility modelling techniques can be applied to ALMA data to study star-forming regions in nearby galaxies. I created a set of scripts designed to fit models to visiblity data using resources on the CANFAR Science Platform. The figure below shows an example of HII emission from the central starburst ring in the galaxy NGC 3351. The left panel shows the observed visibilities after imaging, with contours added to highlight the bright clumps showing increased star formation compared to the rest of the ring. The center panel shows the best fit model for this data, and the right panel shows an image of the residual visibilties, with contours added to highlight the bright clumps present in the observed data that were not modelled. This project allowed me to strengthen my understanding of radio interferometry and imaging techniques, especially those for molecular line data, as well gain experience in writing code for use in cloud computing.'
