Hi there! I'm a physics student at the University of Lethbridge with a passion for astronomy.

I'm not sure what kind of things I would like to put in this tab just yet, so for now, I will just put some notes. I can talk about the fact that I really care about science communication and public outreach (though I don't have a ton to back that up). 

I can talk about the fact that I'm trying to get research experience so that I can figure out what exactly I want to study, and so that I can pad my resume. Talk a little about those cool projects here. 

I can talk about my love of collecting CDs or baking or cats or something. Something nice and humanizing. 

Can talk about my research interests (VERY broadly?)

Idk this is honestly a problem for later.
